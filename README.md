## Working 
The app takes user's birthday date as an input, after that it runs some secret algorithms to check whether the user's birthday in palindromic in nature or not. Let's see the steps user needs to execute: 
1. Enter the birth date.
2. Click on the result button. 
That's it result will be generated. 

### What is a palindrome? 
Any string or number which is same when read from both forward and backward direction is termed to be palindromic in nature. An example for a palindromic number is: 121.
